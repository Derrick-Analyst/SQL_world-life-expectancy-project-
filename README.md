# SQL_world-life-expectancy-project-
in this project, I worked with a real-world dataset on global life expectancy to demonstrate my skills in data cleaning and exploratory data analysis using SQL. I cleaned and structured the data to ensure consistency and accuracy, then used SQL queries to explore trends, identify key health and economic factors affecting life expectancy, and uncover meaningful insights across different countries and years. This project highlights my ability to work with complex datasets, apply SQL for data-driven storytelling, and draw actionable insights from real-worldÂ data.
## overview
This project explores a real-world dataset on global life expectancy using SQL. It demonstrates practical skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and insight generation using structured queries. The goal is to understand the factors influencing life expectancy across different countries and time periods.

## Dataset
The dataset contains life expectancy data from various countries over several years, including indicators such as:
- Life Expectancy
-GDP
Schooling
-Diseases
Status(developed/developing)

## Tools Used
- *SQL* ( MySQL)
  
## Key Insights
- Countries with higher GDP and health expenditure tend to have higher life expectancy.
- Educational attainment (schooling years) correlates positively with life expectancy.
- Life expectancy in developing countries has been gradually improving but still lags behind developed nations.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository
2.  Open the SQL files in your preferred SQL editor.
3. Load the dataset into your SQL database.
4. Run the cleaning and analysis queries step-by-step.
